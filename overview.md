Overview
========

[pymacaron](https://github.com/pymacaron/pymacaron) is a python microservice
framework based on Flask, OpenAPI, pydantic, docker, Celery, AWS and GCP.

PyMacaron aims at abstracting away all the scaffholding of setting up a Flask
microservice, its routes and its deployment pipeline. The only code you
should have to write is the python method for each API endpoint of your
microservice.

## Core features

### OpenAPI specifications

At the core of pymacaron lies your API definitions, in the form of
[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) yaml files.

Each OpenAPI file describes a set of API endpoints, the parameters they take
and the objects they return.

### REST and json

Pymacaron requires your API to consume json-encoded or form-encoded data, and produce
json results.

### Autogenerated Flask code

A Pymacaron server is simply a Flask server whose routes are automatically
generated based on their OpenAPI definitions.

More details [here](http://pymacaron.com/api.html).

### Endpoints that take and return python objects

Pymacaron converts the body of an API request into a pymacaron
model object.

This pymacaron model object is passed to the python method bound to the API endpoint, together
with other query parameters.

The endpoint method returns a different pymacaron model, that gets serialized to json and converted into a Flask Response.

More details [here](https://github.com/pymacaron/pages/blob/master/api.md) and [here](http://pymacaron.com/models.html).

### JWT authentication

Pymacaron supports JWT authentication by default, on a per-endpoint basis.

More details [here](http://pymacaron.com/jwt.html).

### Deployment pipeline

Pymacaron comes with a [deployment
pipeline](http://pymacaron.com/deploy.html) that packages the service as a
[docker image](http://pymacaron.com/docker.html) and deploys it to [Amazon
Beanstalk](http://pymacaron.com/aws.html), [Google Kubernetes](http://pymacaron.com/gke.html)
or [Google Cloud Run](http://pymacaron.com/gcr.html).

### Asynchronous task execution

Pymacaron has optional builtin support for executing python code asynchronously, based on Celery and Redis.

More details [here](http://pymacaron.com/async.html).

### Blackbox testing framework

Pymacaron comes with a [TestCase extension](https://github.com/pymacaron/pymacaron-unit) aimed at testing API endpoints, together
with a [custom nosetest wrapper](https://github.com/pymacaron/pymacaron/blob/master/bin/pymtest).

More details [here](http://pymacaron.com/testing.html).

### Object persistence

Object persistence is achieved by making pymacaron models inherit from a class
that handles persistence and serialisation.
[pymacaron-dynamodb](https://github.com/pymacaron/pymacaron-dynamodb) does that
with Amazon's DynamoDB.
